# Project Status

## Last Update: (Current Date/Time)

## Completed/Current Functionality:

*   Email Monitoring (Microsoft Graph API)
*   Basic Data Extraction (stored in DB)
*   Database Storage (PostgreSQL - Models: `User`, `Email`, `ExtractedData`, `AttachmentMetadata`)
*   Web Application Framework (Flask)
*   User Authentication
*   Dashboard View:
    *   Displays processed emails in a DataTable.
    *   Shows basic email metadata (Sender, Subject, Received).
    *   Shows processing status and whether data was extracted.
    *   Links to detail view.
*   Email Detail View:
    *   Displays details for a single email.
    *   Shows extracted data in a readable key-value format.
    *   Includes "Back to Dashboard" link.

## Current Issues / Blockers:

*   **CSS 404 Error:** Console shows a 404 (Not Found) error for `static/css/style.css` even though the file exists. 
    *   *Attempted:* Confirmed file exists.
    *   *Next Step:* Try restarting the Flask/Gunicorn server. If persists, investigate Flask static file configuration or Replit environment specifics.
*   **Low Email Count:** Dashboard currently shows only 3 emails. 
    *   *Diagnosis:* This is likely due to only 3 emails being processed/stored in the database so far, not a display bug.
    *   *Resolution:* As more emails are processed by the background task, they will appear. Requires patience or triggering more email processing.

## Next Steps / Current Focus:

*   **Feature Development (Prioritized):** Begin implementation of the features outlined in `taskbreakv2.md`.
    *   **Current Focus:** Implement **Manual Editing of Extracted Data**.
        *   *Next Action:* Start with database changes (adding `updated_at`, etc. to `ExtractedData` model).

*   **Resolve CSS 404:** Investigate and fix the 404 error for `style.css` after attempting a server restart.
