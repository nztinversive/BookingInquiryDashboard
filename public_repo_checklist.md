# Public Repository Readiness Checklist

This document tracks the remaining tasks to prepare the Travel Inquiry Processor for a public release.

## Phase 1: Foundation Strengthening & Core Email Improvements

**Goal:** Enhance the stability, reliability, and maintainability of the existing email processing core.

**Remaining Tasks:**

*   [ ] Add more granular error logging with context (email ID, task ID).

## Phase 2: WhatsApp Integration - Backend & Core Logic

**Goal:** Set up the infrastructure and backend logic to receive, store, and send WhatsApp messages.

**Remaining Tasks:**

*   [ ] Implement database migrations (e.g., using Flask-Migrate/Alembic).
*   [ ] **Review Skipped Task:** Outgoing Message Service: Develop a service function to send outgoing WhatsApp messages.
*   [ ] **Review Skipped Task:** Integration with Task Queue: (Optional) Offload any heavy processing related to incoming WhatsApp messages to the task queue.

## Phase 3: Unified Dashboard & Frontend Development

**Goal:** Create a web interface for staff to view and manage both email and WhatsApp inquiries.

**Remaining Tasks:**

*   [ ] Add functionality for staff to trigger outgoing WhatsApp messages (e.g., replies).

## Phase 4: Advanced Features, Optimization & Testing

**Goal:** Refine data processing, implement comprehensive monitoring, and ensure robustness through testing.

**Key Tasks for Public Release:**

*   [ ] **Documentation:**
    *   [ ] Update `README.md` with final setup instructions, architecture, and environment variables.
    *   [ ] Add inline documentation/docstrings to the code.
*   [ ] **Testing Suite:**
    *   [ ] Develop unit tests (`pytest`) for core logic.
    *   [ ] Develop integration tests for component interactions.
    *   [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for key user flows (if feasible).
*   [ ] **Refined Data Extraction & Validation:**
    *   [ ] Implement data validation for extracted data (e.g., Pydantic).
    *   [ ] Implement input sanitization for data persisted to the database.
*   [ ] **Optimized Email Fetching:**
    *   [ ] Evaluate and potentially implement MS Graph Delta Queries or Change Notifications (Webhooks).
*   [ ] **Monitoring & Logging (Advanced):**
    *   [ ] Implement structured logging.
    *   [ ] Set up integration with a centralized logging platform.
    *   [ ] Implement application monitoring.

## General Pre-Release Review

*   [ ] **Security Hardening:**
    *   [ ] **Review Skipped Task:** Migrate API keys and database credentials to a secure Secrets Management solution (if moving beyond Replit Secrets).
    *   [ ] **Review Skipped Task:** Review MS Graph API permissions for least privilege.
    *   [ ] Ensure no secrets are hardcoded anywhere in the repository.
*   [ ] **Final Code Review:** General cleanup, remove unused code, ensure consistency.
*   [ ] **License:** Choose and add an appropriate open-source license file (e.g., `LICENSE.md`).
*   [ ] **Contributing Guidelines:** Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you expect contributions.
